# 🔥 **Auto-Analyst Trial System - Final Architecture**

## 📋 **System Overview**

The Auto-Analyst app now uses a **2-day trial system** where:
- ❌ **No Free Plan** - Users get 0 credits without subscription
- ✅ **Trial Required** - All new users must authorize payment to access features
- 💳 **Payment After Trial** - Stripe charges at day 2 unless canceled
- 🛡️ **Webhook Protected** - All logic handled via Stripe webhooks

---

## 🔄 **Complete User Flow**

### **1. Checkout Flow**
```
User clicks "Start Trial" 
    ↓
Checkout page (/checkout)
    ↓ 
Stripe subscription with 2-day trial
    ↓
Payment method authorization (no charge)
    ↓
Redirect to /checkout/success
    ↓
POST /api/trial/start 
    ↓
500 credits granted immediately
    ↓
Redirect to /account
```

### **2. Trial Cancellation Flow**
```
During Trial (0-2 days):
User cancels → Credits = 0 immediately → No charge ever

After Trial (2+ days):
User cancels → Keep access until month end → Final cleanup via webhook
```

### **3. Payment Capture Flow**
```
Day 2: Stripe auto-captures payment
    ↓
invoice.payment_succeeded webhook
    ↓
Status: trialing → active
    ↓
User keeps 500 credits for full month
```

## 🛠️ **API Endpoints**

### **Core Endpoints**
- `POST /api/checkout-sessions` - Creates Stripe subscription with trial
- `POST /api/trial/start` - Grants trial access after payment auth
- `POST /api/trial/cancel` - Cancels trial (immediate) or subscription (period end)

### **Removed Endpoints** ✅
- ❌ `/api/verify-payment` - No longer needed (trial-only system)
- ❌ `/api/payment-intent-details` - Not used anymore

---

## 🎯 **Webhook Handlers**

### **Essential Webhooks** ✅
1. **`checkout.session.completed`** - Logs checkout completion
2. **`customer.subscription.updated`** - Syncs subscription status changes
3. **`customer.subscription.deleted`** - Final cleanup, sets credits to 0
4. **`customer.subscription.trial_will_end`** - Optional reminder emails
5. **`invoice.payment_succeeded`** - Trial → Active conversion
6. **`invoice.payment_failed`** - Handle failed payment after trial

### **Failure Protection Webhooks** 🛡️
7. **`payment_intent.payment_failed`** - Prevents trial if payment auth fails
8. **`payment_intent.canceled`** - Prevents trial if user cancels during checkout
9. **`setup_intent.setup_failed`** - Prevents trial if payment method setup fails
10. **`payment_intent.requires_action`** - Logs 3D Secure requirements
