## üõ†Ô∏è Issues & Fixes Needed  
The following areas require attention to improve system stability and performance:  

- **WebSocket Connection Handling** ‚Äì Improved error handling is needed for `active_dashboard_connections` and `active_user_connections` management.  
- **Error Handling** ‚Äì Certain API endpoints require more robust exception handling to improve fault tolerance.  
- **Cost Calculation Precision** ‚Äì The floating-point precision in cost calculations may need adjustments, particularly for projected estimates.  
- **Query Performance** ‚Äì Some database queries could be optimized for efficiency when handling large volumes of data.  
- **Static Query** - Change the Data Viz query to be more around the static dataset of Housing.
- **User Icon** - Add a user sign up icon in the chat interface.
- **Code Execution Hover UI** - Fix the hover UI of the code execution.

## üîÑ Development Workflow  
### **Current Workflow:**  
- The project is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces and Vercel.
  - Huging Face Spaces URL: https://ashad001-auto-analyst-backend.hf.space
  - Vercel URL: https://auto-analyst-frontend.vercel.app
- The project follows a **main-branch deployment model** with **CI/CD automation**.  
- **Environment variables** control API endpoints and authentication mechanisms.  
- The codebase is structured with a **clear separation between frontend and backend components**.  

### **Recommended Improvements:**  
- **Terraform** should be used for managing infrastructure as code.  
- **GitHub Actions** should be used for automating the deployment pipeline for AWS.  
- Adopt a **feature branching strategy** to improve collaboration and code isolation.  
- Establish formal **code review guidelines** to ensure maintainability.  
- Document the **contribution workflow** to streamline development efforts.

## üöÄ Production Changes  
### **Deployment Process:**  
- Changes to the **main branch** trigger **automatic deployment** via GitHub Actions.  
- **Terraform** should be used for managing infrastructure as code.  
- AWS resources (**Amplify**) are updated accordingly.  

### **Environment Variables:**  
- `ADMIN_API_KEY` ‚Äì Critical for securing admin access.  
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` ‚Äì Backend API endpoint reference.  
- **AWS credentials** ‚Äì Required for infrastructure provisioning and deployment.  
- **SMTP credentials** ‚Äì Required for sending emails.  
- **OpenAI API Key** ‚Äì Required for the chat interface.  
- **Groq API Key** ‚Äì Required for the chat interface.  
- **Anthropic API Key** ‚Äì Required for the chat interface.  

### **Monitoring Considerations:**  
- Implement **logging** for critical application paths.  
- Track **WebSocket connection stability** to prevent data loss.  
- Validate **cost projections against actual spending trends** to detect anomalies.

## üß™ QA & Testing Strategy  
### **Automated Testing:**  
- Develop **unit tests** for core backend functions.  
- Introduce **integration tests** for API endpoints.  
- Implement **frontend component tests** for UI elements.

    - New chats should be added to the top of the chat history.
    - The chat history should be paginated.
    - The chat history should be sorted by the date of the chat.
    - Chats should be displayed in the chat interface via chat history.
    - Name of the chat history should be a short description of the first query in the chat.
  - Test 5: Run the Code Snippets
    - Code snippets should be runnable and should return the expected results.
