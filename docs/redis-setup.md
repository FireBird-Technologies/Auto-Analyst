# Redis (Upstash) Schema for Subscription Management  

This project uses **Redis (Upstash)** to store user subscription data, credits, and related metadata. The data is stored using **hash-based storage** for efficient retrieval.

## **Key Structure**  

The Redis keys follow a structured naming convention for organization:

- **User Subscription Data:** `user:{userId}:subscription`
- **User Credit Data:** `user:{userId}:credits`
- **User Profile Data:** `user:{userId}:profile`

## üõ† **Operations Performed in API**  

1. **Fetching User Subscription Data:**  
   - Retrieves subscription details from `user:{userId}:subscription`  
   - Determines the **plan type** (`FREE`, `STANDARD`, `PRO`)  
   - Calculates **renewal date** based on `purchaseDate` & `interval`  
   - Manages **monthly resets** for yearly subscriptions  

2. **Fetching User Credits:**  
   - Retrieves credit usage from `user:{userId}:credits`  
   - Resets monthly credits if applicable  
   - Ensures correct handling of **yearly plans**  

3. **Handling Yearly Subscriptions:**  
   - Adds `nextMonthlyReset` for yearly plans  
   - Ensures credits reset monthly even in yearly billing cycles  

## üîÑ **Subscription Renewal Process**

The application includes an automated subscription renewal system specifically for STANDARD plan users:

### **How It Works**

1. When a STANDARD plan user's renewal date is reached, their subscription is automatically renewed with the same plan details.
2. The renewal process:
   - Updates the renewal date to the next period (adds one month or one year)
   - Resets their credits (to 500 for STANDARD plan)
   - Maintains the subscription status as "active"

### **Setting Up the Cron Job**

To ensure that subscriptions are checked and renewed regularly:

1. A cron job should be set up to call the renewal API endpoint:
   - Endpoint: `/api/cron/process-renewals`
   - HTTP Method: GET
   - Required header: `x-cron-auth-key: [your-configured-key]`

2. Environment Configuration:
   - Add `CRON_AUTH_KEY` to your environment variables with a secure, random value
   - This key must be included in the request header for security

3. Recommended Schedule:
   - Run daily (e.g., `0 0 * * *` in cron syntax - runs at midnight every day)
   - This ensures subscriptions are renewed promptly when their renewal date is reached

4. Upstash Cron Setup:
   ```bash
   # Example using curl to test the endpoint
   curl -X GET https://yourdomain.com/api/cron/process-renewals \
     -H "x-cron-auth-key: your-configured-key"
   ```

5. Logging:
   - The renewal process logs detailed information about:
     - Total subscriptions processed
     - Number of subscriptions renewed
     - Number of subscriptions downgraded (for non-STANDARD plans that expire)

Note: PRO plan subscriptions that expire are downgraded to the FREE plan, while STANDARD plan subscriptions are automatically renewed.
