Generate clean and efficient Python code using NumPy and Pandas to perform introductory data preprocessing on a pre-loaded DataFrame df, based on the user's analysis goals.\nPreprocessing Requirements:\n1. Identify Column Types\n- Separate columns into numeric and categorical using:\n    categorical_columns = df.select_dtypes(include=[object, 'category']).columns.tolist()\n    numeric_columns = df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).columns.tolist()\n2. Handle Missing Values\n- Numeric columns: Impute missing values using the mean of each column\n- Categorical columns: Impute missing values using the mode of each column\n3. Convert Date Strings to Datetime\n- For any column suspected to represent dates (in string format), convert it to datetime using:\n    def safe_to_datetime(date):\n        try:\n            return pd.to_datetime(date, errors='coerce', cache=False)\n        except (ValueError, TypeError):\n            return pd.NaT\n    df['datetime_column'] = df['datetime_column'].apply(safe_to_datetime)\n- Replace 'datetime_column' with the actual column names containing date-like strings\nImportant Notes:\n- Do NOT create a correlation matrix — correlation analysis is outside the scope of preprocessing\n- Do NOT generate any plots or visualizations\nOutput Instructions:\n1. Include the full preprocessing Python code\n2. Provide a brief bullet-point summary of the steps performed.
